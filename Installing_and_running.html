    <title>Installing and running</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <b>1. Installation.</b><br>
    <br>
    Isaac currently runs on Linux. Mac OS X ports will be disabled until
    issues with audio are fixed (pre-July versions should work, but
    require manual adjustments).<br>
    <br>
    <u><br>
      1.1. Download the source code via </u><br>
    <br>
    &gt; git clone https://github.com/grabherr/Isaac<br>
    <br>
    <u><br>
      1.2. Install the necessary development libraries via </u><br>
    <br>
    &gt; sudo apt-get install libx11-dev mesa-common-dev freeglut3-dev
    libxcursor-dev subversion libasound2-dev<br>
    <br>
    on Ubuntu/Mint/Debian, or use the equivalent package manager on your
    distribution. These libraries are required by Isaac and/or the
    irrlicht engine.<br>
    <br>
    <u><br>
      1.3. Compile the software</u><br>
    <br>
    Type <br>
    <br>
    &gt; make <br>
    <br>
    (we recommend using the -j option for parallel make)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>1.4 Install Irrlicht</u><br>
    <br>
    Run the script <br>
    <br>
    &gt; ./getIrrlicht<br>
    <br>
    This will download, install, and compile the current version of the
    Irrlicht engine. If you run into any issues during compilation or
    runtime, we recommend using the latest stable version ibntead.<br>
    <br>
    <u>1.5 Compile the Irrlicht client</u><br>
    <br>
    Run<br>
    <br>
    &gt; ./compileIrrlicht<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>1.6 Test the installation</u><br>
    <br>
    If there were no errors during the build, test the system by running<br>
    <br>
    ./TestGameEngine -i data/empty.cfg<br>
    <br>
    This will bring up the client in full screen mode, with minimal
    decorations (floor, skyboxes), and allows you to move around using
    the arrow keys and mouse.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>2. Running coding examples.</b><br>
    <br>
    All test programs require a configuration file. The minimal
    configuration is supplied in data/empty.cfg, a configuration with
    simple objects is supplied by data/experiment.cfg.<br>
    <br>
    IMPORTANT: Always redirect the output of the executables, as they
    will produce a lot of debugging info!!<br>
    <br>
    Selected examples:<br>
    <br>
    ./TestSwarming: a simple bird swarm/flock simulator (with sound)<br>
    <br>
    ./TestEcho: demonstration of the dynamic sound system<br>
    <br>
    ./GenomeBrowser: browse the genome of the bacterium E. coli strain
    K12 in three dimensions.<br>
