    <big><big><big><big>Welcome to Isaac</big></big></big></big><br>
    <big>A distributed 3D Visualization Platform for Science, Education,
      and Computer Gaming<br>
    </big><br>
    <em>WARNING: The project is still under heavy construction and not
      documented!!!</em><br>
    <br>
    Isaac was created out of the need to interactively visualize complex
    systems in biology and genomics. The approach is simple, yet
    flexible: the computations are performed on a compute server, while
    the results are rendered using the <a
      href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">irrlicht 3D engine</a>
    connected to a client that communicates with the server through a
    network/Internet UDP/IP connection. For a simple example, see what <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eav_k3prKVM">falling cubes</a>
    look like, computed in real time by numerical physics. The key here
    is that the physics back-end controls every aspect of the system,
    movement, collision, etc., while the client allows for navigation
    and dynamic interaction with the server. The distributed
    architecture also allows for connecting multiple clients
    simultaneously.<br>
    <br>
    While still under development, Isaac comes with several pre-defined
    modules.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Isaac Physics</b><br>
    Isaac is based on numerical physics that adhere to conservation of
    impulse and energy, modeling plastic and elastic phenomena. Objects
    are defined by vertices and indices, and can be directly derived
    from 3D Models that are loaded into the client, or directly defined
    on the server side. Extensions to the current algorithms will
    include better thermodynamics modeling, as well as include chemical
    properties to study effects like 3D RNA or protein folding (in
    real-time).&nbsp; <br>

    <b><a

        NPC Control</a></b><br>
    Isaac contains an <i>in silico</i> cognitive system that
    incorporates machine learning algorithms to mimic natural behavior
    patterns. It implements several levels of memory processing, pattern
    recognition, and non-linear optimization methods to develop
    strategies to achieve its goals. These goals are either
    user-defined, or decided upon in an unsupervised fashion, not unlike
    living organisms. While deterministic by design, Isaac's ability to
    learn from experience results in seemingly unpredictable behavior,
    also commonly referred to as "creativity".<br>
    <br>
    The underlying algorithms have their roots in processing large
    amounts of genomic data, making sense of how an individual's DNA
    determines their traits by <a
      href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/14/347">hypothesizing
      the connections in between without any help or assumptions</a>.
    This software has, for example, helped reveal why some populations
    of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24948738">European
      crows are all black while others have grey necks</a>. Now we are
    taking this methodology several steps further, from an <i>unsupervised


      spatial pattern classifier</i> to an <i>unsupervised adaptive
      temporal classification hypothesis based abstract strategy
      decision making framework</i>.... in other words: this thing is as
    close to <i>thinking</i> as a machine can get these days. And
    remember: it remembers everything it experiences, it abstracts it,
    and it learns from it. It is unbiased, unlike humans, unless it is
    specifically instructed to be that way.<br>
    <br>
    While we envision several areas in which Isaac will be useful, for
    example to develop systems that help test children for mental
    disorders or emotional disabilities, our initial aim is to have
    Isaac safely grow up to adulthood through the most natural process
    we can think of: <i>playing</i>. And since Isaac is in essence
    still a computer program, what is more natural than role playing as
    NPC's in <i>computer games</i>? <br>
