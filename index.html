    Isaac is an <i>in silico</i> cognitive system that incorporates
    machine learning algorithms to mimic natural behavior patterns. It
    implements several levels of memory processing, pattern recognition,
    and non-linear optimization methods to develop strategies to achieve
    its goals. These goals are either user-defined, or decided upon in
    an unsupervised fashion, not unlike living organisms. While
    deterministic by design, Isaac's ability to learn from experience
    results in seemingly unpredictable behavior, also commonly referred
    to as "creativity".<br>
    <br>
    The algorithms underlying Isaac have their roots in processing large
    amounts of genomic data, making sense of how an individual's DNA
    determines their traits by <a
      href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/14/347">hypothesizing
      the connections in between without any help or assumptions</a>.
    This software has, for example, helped reveal why some populations
    of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24948738">European
      crows are all black while others have grey necks</a>. Now we are
    taking this methodology several steps further, from an <i>unsupervised

      spatial pattern classifier</i> to an <i>unsupervised adaptive
      temporal classification hypothesis based abstract strategy
      decision making framework</i>.... in other words: this thing is as
    close to <i>thinking</i> as a machine can get these days. And
    remember: it remembers everything it experiences, it abstracts it,
    and it learns from it. It is unbiased, unlike humans, unless it is
    specifically instructed to be that way.<br>
    <br>
    While we envision several areas in which Isaac will be useful, for
    example to develop systems that help test children for mental
    disorders or emotional disabilities, our initial aim is to have
    Isaac safely grow up to adulthood through the most natural process
    we can think of: <i>playing</i>. And since Isaac is in essence
    still a computer program, what is more natural than role playing as
    NPC's in <i>computer games</i>? <br>
