    <b>Open Source License</b><br>
    Isaac is freely available under GPL, which means that we encourage
    you to use it in your projects or development, completely free of
    charge. However, for helping us improve the software, we would ask
    you to give us feedback. We are looking forward to seeing our
    software taking an active role in your game.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Commercial use</b><br>
    Please note that GPL requires any software that builds upon anything
    using GPL to be released under the same license, which includes
    releasing all source code to the public. Under "builds upon", we
    both understand code that integrates our software, as well as other
    data, including models, maps, sounds etc. If you would like to
    license Isaac under an alternative, commercial license, please
    contact us.<br>
